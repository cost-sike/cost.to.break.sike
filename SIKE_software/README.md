# Software implementation of SIKE 
# Paper "The Cost to Break SIKE: A Comparative Hardware-Based Analysis with AES and SHA-3"

This library contains efficient C implementations of the CCA-secure key encapsulation mechanism "SIKE". 
This scheme is conjectured to be secure against quantum computer attacks.
The software is based on the SIDH library version 3.3 (https://github.com/microsoft/PQCrypto-SIDH).

This library includes the following KEM schemes:

* SIKEp377: matching the post-quantum security of AES128 (NEW, level 1).
* SIKEp434: matching the post-quantum security of AES128 (level 1).
* SIKEp503: matching the post-quantum security of SHA3-256 (level 2).
* SIKEp546: matching the post-quantum security of AES192 (NEW, level 3).
* SIKEp610: matching the post-quantum security of AES192 (level 3).
* SIKEp697: matching the post-quantum security of AES256 (NEW, level 5).
* SIKEp751: matching the post-quantum security of AES256 (level 5).

## Instructions for Linux

By executing:

```sh
$ make
```

the library is compiled by default for x64 using clang, optimization level `FAST` that uses assembly-optimized arithmetic
(this option requires CPU support for the instructions MULX and ADX).

Other options for x64:

```sh
$ make CC=[gcc/clang] OPT_LEVEL=[FAST/GENERIC]
```

The use of `OPT_LEVEL=GENERIC` disables the use of assembly-optimized arithmetic.

To run the different tests and benchmarking results, execute:

```sh
$ ./arith_tests-pXXX
$ ./sikeXXX/test_SIKE
```
